                    Tutors at MLWU are trained with the most up to date tools and development practices
                    as set by industry standards. Unlike maths or literature, the world of software is
                    constantly evolving, and MLWU works on the belief that instruction must evolve with
                    it.

                <h2 class="sectionHeading">Pair programming</h2>
                <p>
                    Pair programming is used to great effect at a wide range of companies including
                    Facebook, Twitter, Braintree, and Pivotal. Through mentorship, senior developers
                    are able to accelerate junior developers' careers, and pairing is core.
                    MLWU believes the same can be implimented between tutors and students with a similar
                    outcome.
